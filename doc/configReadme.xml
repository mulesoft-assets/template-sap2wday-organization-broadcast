This Anypoint Template should serve as a foundation for setting an online sync of materials from SAP to Salesforce.
Every time there is a new material (SFDC product) or a change in an already existing one, SAP will send the IDoc with it to the running template which will update/create a product in Salesforce target instance.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.

As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverages the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing). The batch job is divided in Input, Process and On Complete stages.

The integration is triggered by a SAP Endpoint that receives the SAP Material as IDoc XML. This XML is passed to the batch process.
In the Batch Input stage the SAP Material is transformed to a Salesforce Product and it is upserted in the Batch Step to Salesforce using a Batch Commit.
Finally during the On Complete stage the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console.

		<![CDATA[
To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered.
All of them deal with the preparations in both source (SAP) and destination (SFDC) systems, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly.
**Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

Before continue with the use of this Anypoint Template, you may want to check out this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/SAP+Connector#SAPConnector-EnablingYourStudioProjectforSAP), that will teach you how to work 
with SAP and Anypoint Studio.

## Disclaimer

This Anypoint template uses a few private Maven dependencies in order to work. If you intend to run this template with Maven support, please continue reading.

You will find that there are three dependencies in the pom.xml file that begin with the following group id: 
	**com.sap.conn.jco** 
These dependencies are private for Mulesoft and will cause you application not to build from a Maven command line. You need to replace them with "provided" scope and copy the libraries into the build path.

The Partner profile needs to have a customized type of logical system set as partner type. An outbound parameter of message type MATMAS should be defined in the partner profile. A RFC destination created earlier should be defined as Receiver Port. Idoc Type base type should be set as MATMAS01.

This template makes use of the `External ID` field offered by Salesforce. Here is a short description on how SFDC define external ID's 

+ [What is an external ID?](http://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=faq_import_general_what_is_an_external.htm)

The templates uses the External ID in order to do xRef between the entities in both systems. The idea is, once an entity is created in SFDC it's decorated with an ID from the source system which will be used afteward for the template to reference it.

You will need to create a new custom field in your **Product** entity in SFDC with the following name: 

+ `sap_external_id`

For instructions on how to create a custom field in SFDC plase check this link:

		<section id="api_calls">
		<![CDATA[
SalesForce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made.
Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to
consider. Product Broadcast Template calls to the API can be
calculated using the formula:

**X / 200**

Being X the number of Products to be synchronized on each run.

The division by 200 is because, by default, Users are gathered in groups
of 200 for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. Also consider
that this calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 1 api
calls to SFDC will be made ( 1).
